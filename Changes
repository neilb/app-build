0.70 2007-12-24
    - Undo @ARGV stripping done by App::Options without relying on App::Options
      internals.

0.69 2007-12-11
    - Fix the handling of standard build types (for example libdoc) by fixing
      install_base return value when used as an accessor.
    - Undo the @ARGV stripping done by App::Options to allow Module::Build
      option processing to work as expected.
    - Allow overriding paths specified by extra_dirs->dest_dir using
      the standard --install_path option.
    - Make the paths specified by install_path relative to install prefix
      when they are relative (Module::Build behaviour is to make them
      relative to current directory). 

0.68 2007-06-17
    - Some test fixes for Perl 5.6.2 and when Archive::Extract/File::Fetch
      are not present.

0.67 2007-06-13
    - Rewritten mirror() to use File::Fetch.
    - Rewritten unpack() to use Archive::Extract.
    - Changed mirror() and unpack() into instance methods and use log_info()
      instead of print inside them.

0.66 2007-06-05
    - More comprehensive tests, remove unused code and some
      warnings.

0.65 2007-05-31
    - Fix some warnings when install_base is not specified.
    - Allow calling install_base after the App::Build object
      has been constructed.
    - Fix handling of the default 'dest_dir' attribute when
      'extra_dirs' is specified as an hash.
    - Fix compatibility with Module::Build 0.28 and require it.

0.64 2007-05-10
    - Do not use App::Build in App::Build's Build.PL because it breaks
      site/vendor selection operated (for example) by Gentoo g-cpan.

0.63 2007-05-08
    - Re-release changing the maintainer.

0.62 2006-02-16
    - Ensure that SVN files (files in */.svn) are not copied/installed

0.61 2005-08-18
    - Fixed some test cases that were erroring out

0.60 2005-04-21
    - Remove "Build" from @ARGV to get around weirdness with CPAN shell
    - PREFIX is a synonym for install_base
    - install scripts into $PREFIX/bin, not $PREFIX/scripts.
    - override has_config_data() to always return false to overcome weirdness
    - added regression tests (t/main.t)
    - add the "execute" attribute on "extra_dirs"
    - adds execute permission only to #! files in dirs that contain executables

0.50 2005-04-20
    - Cause "bin" directories (i.e. cgi-bin) to have
      perl interpreter substitution
    - Ensure execute permission set on "bin" directories
    - Properly write the .packlist
      (right location, right contents, right format)
    - Ensure that packlist is written when no "module_name" exists
    - Ensure that CVS and RCS files are not copied/installed

0.10 2005-04-20
    - Initial release
    - Cause extra_dirs to be installed
    - Add configure() hook
    - Ensure that "lib" is always at the head of @INC
    - Works with install_base or not
    - unset $ENV{PREFIX} so that Module::Build doesn't complain
